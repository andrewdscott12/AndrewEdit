## An AI generated GTK text editor  
  
This text editor was created using Qwen-2.5:7B. It has minimal functionality and was created to demonstrate AI code generation.

It is written for the GTK widget set and is intended for compile on Ubuntu Linux. It likely will compile on any other Unix like system with a modern GTK implementation, but it has not been tested.

This code is AI generated and is released into the public domain.
